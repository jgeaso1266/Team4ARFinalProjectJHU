**Note:** You may need to independently install and configure [PUN2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922) and [MRTK2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102778).

To test the PUN functionality, you must either deploy this project to at least one Hololens or create a duplicate project, and play both scenes (on Hololens and/or in simulation). 

You must start the game in the `AngryBirdLauncher` scene. This will create a PUN room for all devices connected to the server. This will then automatically bring you to the Angry Birds scene.
